For this SQL, I queried a database with multiple tables to analyze data about the customers, sales, and orders.

/**How many sales were placed in January?**/
SELECT COUNT (orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

/**How many of those orders were from an iPhone?**/
SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

/**Select customer account numbers for all orders that were placed in Febuary**/
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID;

/**Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, what was the price?**/
SELECT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY asc;

/**What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).**/
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

/**Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?**/
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) AS total_items_sold, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

/**How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?**/
SELECT COUNT (cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.quantity > 2;
