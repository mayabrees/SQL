For this SQL, I queried a database with multiple tables to analyze data about the customers, sales, and orders.

/**How many sales were placed in January?**/
SELECT COUNT (orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

/**How many of those orders were from an iPhone?**/
SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

/**Select customer account numbers for all orders that were placed in Febuary**/
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID;

/**Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, what was the price?**/
SELECT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY asc;

/**What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).**/
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

/**Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?**/
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) AS total_items_sold, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

/**How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?**/
SELECT COUNT (cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.quantity > 2;

/**Advanced Filtering Techniques**/
SELECT orderdate
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate between '02/13/19 00:00' AND '02/18/19 00:00';

SELECT location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE orderdate = '02/18/19 01:35';

SELECT sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE orderdate like '02/18/19%';

SELECT orderdate
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales;

SELECT distinct Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%Batteries%';

SELECT distinct Product, Price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Price like '%.99';

/**List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.**/
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;

/**Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?**/
SELECT DISTINCT location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) > 2; 

/**How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?**/
SELECT DISTINCT product, SUM(quantity) AS quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product LIKE '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product;

/**What was the average amount spent per account in February?**/
SELECT SUM(quantity*price) / COUNT (cust.acctnum) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id;

/**What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?**/
SELECT SUM(quantity) / COUNT(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id;

/**Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?**/
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY SUM(quantity*price) desc
LIMIT 1;
